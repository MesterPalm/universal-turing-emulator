# Universal Turing Emulator
In Alan Turings 1936 paper "On computable numbers with an application to the entscheidugsproblem"
he otlines the specifications of a machine capable of computing any computable number.
This is often considered one of the seminal works of computer-science field and a machine with
the same computational capabilites as Turings computing machine is now called "a Turing machine" or
"Turing complete".

This project is an attempt at creating a program that calculates in the same way and uses the same
aproximate syntax/notation for a program as Turing uses in his paper.
